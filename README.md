# Breaking RSA encryption with qiskit

RSA cryptosystem which is widely used on the Internet for secure data transmission. The power and security of the RSA cryptosystem derives from the fact that the factoring problem is “hard.” That is, it is believed that the full decryption of an RSA ciphertext is infeasible because no efficient classical algorithm currently exists for factoring large numbers. However, in 1994 Peter Shor showed that a quantum computer could be used to factor a number
in polynomial time, thus effectively breaking RSA. check out the program.
