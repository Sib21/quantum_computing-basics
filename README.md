# quantum_computing-basics

this repository holds quantum computing programs using python and quatum libraries built for python like cirq and qiskit

RSA cryptosystem which is widely used on the Internet for secure data transmission. The power and security of the RSA cryptosystem derives from the fact that the factoring problem is “hard.” That is, it is believed that the full decryption of an RSA ciphertext is infeasible because no efficient classical algorithm currently exists for factoring large numbers. However, in 1994 Peter Shor showed that a quantum computer could be used to factor a number
in polynomial time, thus effectively breaking RSA.

here is how we can use easily break RSA encryption with 10 lines of python using qiskit library on IBM quatum computer. try for yourself.
